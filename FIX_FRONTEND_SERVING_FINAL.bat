echo FIX FRONTEND SERVING IN BLUEPRINT INTEGRATED
echo ========================================
echo.

echo ðŸŽ¯ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
echo    - URL shows backend JSON instead of React frontend
echo    - Frontend build not being served properly
echo    - Blueprint Integrated should show React app, not backend response
echo.

echo âœ… FIXES APPLIED:
echo    1. Enhanced build script with verification
echo    2. Added publishDirectory to render.yaml
echo    3. Improved frontend build copying process
echo    4. Added build verification steps
echo    5. Enhanced error handling and logging
echo.

echo 1. Committing frontend serving fixes...
git add .
git commit -m "FIX: Frontend serving in Blueprint Integrated - enhance build process, add verification, fix render.yaml"
echo.

echo 2. Pushing fixes to repository...
git push origin main
echo.

echo 3. Render will auto-deploy with fixes...
echo    - Frontend will be built and copied correctly
echo    - Backend will serve the React app
echo    - URL will show React interface instead of backend JSON
echo.

echo 4. Expected Results After Deployment:
echo    âœ… URL shows React app instead of backend JSON
echo    âœ… Frontend loads correctly with navigation
echo    âœ… API requests work with relative paths (/api/*)
echo    âœ… No CORS errors
echo    âœ… Full Blueprint Integrated functionality
echo.

echo 5. If frontend still doesn't load, check Render logs for:
echo    - "Frontend build created successfully"
echo    - "Frontend build copied successfully to backend"
echo    - "Serving React app for route: /"
echo.

echo ========================================
echo FRONTEND SERVING FIX DEPLOYED!
echo ========================================
echo.
echo ðŸŽ‰ The URL should now show the React app instead of backend JSON!
echo    Wait 2-5 minutes for Render to complete the deployment.
