echo FIX FRONTEND SERVING IN BLUEPRINT INTEGRATED
echo ========================================
echo.

echo ðŸŽ¯ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
echo    - Backend is running but frontend is not being served
echo    - URL shows backend response instead of React app
echo    - Frontend build folder not found or not being served
echo.

echo âœ… FIXES APPLIED:
echo    1. Updated backend to check multiple build paths
echo    2. Enhanced static file serving logic
echo    3. Improved catch-all handler for React Router
echo    4. Added comprehensive build scripts
echo    5. Enhanced error logging for debugging
echo.

echo 1. Committing frontend serving fixes...
git add .
git commit -m "FIX: Frontend serving in Blueprint Integrated - check multiple build paths, enhance static serving"
echo.

echo 2. Pushing fixes to repository...
git push origin main
echo.

echo 3. Render will auto-deploy with fixes...
echo    - Backend will check both build paths
echo    - Frontend will be served correctly
echo    - React app will load instead of backend JSON
echo.

echo 4. Expected Results After Deployment:
echo    âœ… URL shows React app instead of backend JSON
echo    âœ… Frontend loads correctly
echo    âœ… API requests work with relative paths
echo    âœ… No CORS errors
echo    âœ… Full Blueprint Integrated functionality
echo.

echo 5. If frontend still doesn't load, check Render logs for:
echo    - "Frontend build folder found at:"
echo    - "Serving static files from:"
echo    - "Serving React app for route:"
echo.

echo ========================================
echo FRONTEND SERVING FIX DEPLOYED!
echo ========================================
echo.
echo ðŸŽ‰ The URL should now show the React app instead of backend JSON!
